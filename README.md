# Joining-Parts-Of-A-Sentence

A lot of existing ChatBot APIs extract the Intents and Parts of a sentence and return them to the user. The problem, however, arises in automating the process of connecting the Intents with the right Parts and vice-versa. 

For example, "" 

This API attempts to connect the extracted entites using multiple grammatical rules and functions.
